# Movie-Match
Movie Match app for a PWM course

“Movie Match” is a web and mobile application designed to simplify the process of choosing movies. Users will be presented with a movie poster and its description. They can decide if they like the movie or not by swiping in the appropriate direction. When users are unsure of what to watch, they can browse and filter movies from their liked list. They can also use a “shake” option, where the app will choose a random movie from their liked list. Our app is called “Movie Match” because users can match their liked movies with another user and then search for a movie to watch together. Users will be connected by a special code, unique for each user.
